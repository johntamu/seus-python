Collection sites further out into the Blake Plateau have lower d15N at approxiamtely 500m depth versus the collection sites from closer to the continental slope. 

Low d15N values would be consistent with nitrogen fixation, which globall is considered to be about -1 permil d15N. Jacksonville is a bit elevated which could correspond to nutrient utilization at the time. In general the contintental slope values are around 5 permil, close to oceanic values. This could therefore be indicative of water sourced from the tropics with fixed nitrogen resulting from Trichodesmium in the tropics.

Why would collection sites further away have slightly lower d15N however? Remember, this is d15N-NO3! not organic matter, which means the ratio of 15N/14N is lowering (14-NO3 is not being preferentially removed for some biological process). Water column denitrification would result in a much higher d15N of nitrate along with increased nutrient utilization. 

I do think I read another mechanism that could result in a large increase in d15N (perhaps what is causing what is apparent in the MCA with Jack/Sav?)
